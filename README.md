# Studio 5
This contains the technical and software elements of the project, detailing what has been used, how to set up, and how each piece of software communicates with each other.

# Project 2
Project 2 is on the more astetic side of things, as it gives indepth detail into how the components conjoin together. However, as I was unable to migrate a majority of the schematics to this repository due to file size limitations, I've provided links to the original source, as well as a link to my gitlab that has all the resources.
